## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
Scavenger hunt is a web platform for a QR reading based quiz game.
Through any mobile device camera it can scan different QR codes that start different quizes.
For any scanned QR the web platform serves a set of question and possible answers (behaving like radio buttons). 
If the answer given by user is correct the platform serves a badge with a hint of the position of next QR to scan.

### How it works
1. User is presented with a first QR
2. User scans QR
3. User gets redirected to web app
4. User is presented a question and answers
5. User answers correctly
6. User is given a victory collectible item
7. User moves to the next QR code
